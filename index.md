## About Me

I am an MSc student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) majoring in Machine Intelligence with an intended minor in Theoretical Computer Science.

Previously, I was a researcher in computer vision, affiliated with the [Intelligent Visual Analytics Lab (IVAL)](https://www.ival-mbzuai.com/) at the [Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) where I was supervised by [Dr. Salman Khan](https://scholar.google.com.pk/citations?user=M59O9lkAAAAJ&hl=en)

I hold a Bachelor degree in Computer Science from the [Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)](https://lums.edu.pk/) in Lahore, Pakistan

*Apart from all that, you will probably find me playing chess during my free time :p*

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** Video and Vision-Language Understanding
